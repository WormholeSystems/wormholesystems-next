# Reporting a vulnerability

Please report anything security-relevant through
[GitHub's private advisory form](https://github.com/WormholeSystems/wormholesystems-next/security/advisories/new)
rather than a public issue.

## What is worth reporting

A deployment holds the EVE refresh token of every linked character, so anything that reads
another account's data, escalates a role on a map, or gets at the database is worth
raising. So is anything that lets a map be read or written by somebody the access rules say
should not be able to.

## What is already known

- **Refresh tokens are stored unencrypted.** Whoever can read the database can act as any
  linked character within the scopes it granted. This is a known property rather than a
  bug; see the note in `migrations/0001_auth.sql`.
- **This is pre-alpha.** It has not been audited, and it is not run anywhere that matters
  yet. Please report things anyway — knowing early is the point of saying so.

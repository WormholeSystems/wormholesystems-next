# Background Processes

Scheduled / background work the server runs outside of request handling. One section
per job: its purpose, triggers, and the data it touches.

## Affiliation refresh

Keeps each [`characters`](./database/authentication.md#characters) row's
`corporation_id` / `alliance_id` current. This matters because those fields **drive
[access](./database/access.md)**: a map can grant access to a whole corporation or
alliance, so when a character's affiliation changes, what maps they can reach must
change too. Both triggers use the bulk
[character affiliation](./esi/characters-affiliation.md) endpoint.

### On authentication

When a user logs in — or links / re-authenticates a character — we refetch the
affiliation of the user's characters and update their corp/alliance **before**
resolving access. So someone who just left a corporation can't get in on stale data at
login.

### Periodic (the background job)

Users who don't log in would otherwise keep stale affiliations indefinitely, so a
scheduled job refetches the affiliations of **all** characters assigned to users:

- Batch every character id through `POST /characters/affiliation` (≤ 1000 ids per
  call), update `corporation_id` / `alliance_id`, and bump `updated_at`.
- A character that has left its corporation/alliance stops matching that corp/alliance
  `map_access` grant on the next run → **access is lost within one refresh interval.**

**Invariants & expected behaviour**

- After a run, every character's stored corp/alliance equals what ESI reports.
- A character no longer in a granted corporation/alliance loses that
  affiliation-derived access at the next run — bounded staleness equals the interval.
- **Direct character-id grants are unaffected** by affiliation changes; they persist
  until explicitly removed.

> **Open — interval.** How fresh must access be — i.e. the maximum acceptable lag
> between someone leaving a corp and losing access? That sets the job interval (e.g.
> 15 min vs. hourly), and whether each run is a full sweep or staggered batches.

## Character status polling

Keeps [`character_status`](./database/tracking.md#character_status) live for characters
whose user is actively using the app — without burning ESI calls on idle users or
offline characters. A **two-tier** poll, gated by app activity.

**Eligibility — active users only.** We poll only the characters of a user who has
interacted with the app **within the last 5 minutes**, measured by
[`users.last_active_at`](./database/authentication.md#users). When a user goes idle
past that window, *all* polling for their characters stops.

**Tier 1 — online state, every 60 s.** For each eligible character, call
[`GET …/online`](./esi/character-online.md) (`esi-location.read_online.v1`) and update
`online` / `last_online_at`.

**Tier 2 — location + ship, every 5 s.** *Only for characters currently online*, call
[`GET …/location`](./esi/character-location.md) and
[`GET …/ship`](./esi/character-ship.md), updating `solar_system_id` +
station/structure (→ derived `is_docked`) and the `ship_*` fields.

**Transitions**

- A character seen **offline** in Tier 1 drops out of Tier 2 until it is online again.
- A character that comes **online** in Tier 1 enters Tier 2 on the next 5 s tick.
- A user that goes **idle** (>5 min) removes all their characters from both tiers.

**Invariants & expected behaviour**

- A character is in Tier 2 **iff** it is online *and* its user is active (<5 min).
- An offline character is never polled for location/ship.
- An idle user's characters are not polled at all (neither tier).
- Each poll needs the matching scope (online / location / ship); a missing scope skips
  that field, which stays `null` (see [scopes](./database/authentication.md#esi_scopes)).
- Cadences track ESI's cache windows — honour each response's cache-expiry / `ETag`
  rather than re-requesting inside a cached window.

## Sovereignty refresh

Keeps [`system_sovereignty`](./database/universe.md#system_sovereignty) current — who
holds each K-space system — for display on the map.

- Periodically pull [`GET /sovereignty/systems`](./esi/sovereignty-systems.md) (public,
  whole-of-New-Eden in one call) and upsert one row per claimed system: alliance +
  corporation, or faction; clear systems that became unclaimed.
- Sovereignty changes slowly relative to presence, so this runs on a coarse cadence
  (not the per-second tier of status polling).

**Invariants & expected behaviour**

- After a run, every system's stored holder equals what ESI reports; flipped systems
  reflect their new owner; unclaimed systems carry no holder.

> **Open — interval.** Refresh cadence for sovereignty (e.g. every few minutes vs.
> hourly) — slower than presence, but how slow?

## Connection life-cycle

Wormholes die on a clock, and a chain nobody is flying is not re-scanned. One loop, every
10 minutes, does what a pilot would: marks the holes that must be running out, and drops
the ones that cannot still be there. Both go through the command layer as the system
actor, so each change is an audit entry in the map's history (never an undo step) and
open maps refetch it like any edit. Mirrors legacy's `CheckConnectionAge` and the
connection half of its `DeleteOldSignatures`.

### Ageing

For every wormhole edge not already `critical`, the mark its age has earned:

| Hole | Lifetime | `eol` from | `critical` from |
|---|---|---|---|
| any wormhole | 24 h | 20 h | 23 h |
| C6 to known space | 48 h | 44 h | 47 h |
| drifter (C14 to C18) to known space | 16 h | 12 h | 15 h |

Age is `now - created_at` (an import keeps the connection's original `connected_at`
there). Known space is class 7, 8 or 9. A ghost endpoint has no class, so a hole into one
runs on the 24 h clock.

An edge already at `eol` is judged from its mark instead: `critical` once
`time_status_updated_at` is 3 h old. A pilot's EOL mark often comes from a scan of a hole
older than the map knows, so the mark beats the age.

**Invariants**

- Only escalates. `stable`, `eol` and `critical` marks set by a pilot are never lowered,
  and an unknown (`null`) hole stays unknown until it earns `eol`.
- The mark lands on the edge; the `map_conn_sync` trigger carries it to the linked
  signatures and stamps `time_status_updated_at`.
- Stargate edges never age.
- One `connections.aged` entry per mark, with no character.

### Expiry

No wormhole lives 3 days. Every wormhole edge whose `created_at` is older than that is
removed, along with the placements it strands (the same orphan rule as the manual stale
sweep: unpinned, not home, not rally, and now edgeless). One `connections.expired` entry
per map per run.

The signatures it was linked to are unlinked, not deleted; the
[signature expiry](#see-also--other-periodic-work) collects them on its own schedule,
since a wormhole signature that old is past its 3 day cutoff too.

Documented with their own tables; listed here so the background-work picture is in one
place:

- Access-token refresh from the stored refresh token
  ([`esi_tokens`](./database/authentication.md#esi_tokens)).
- Expiry / cleanup of expired
  [`oauth_login_flows`](./database/authentication.md#oauth_login_flows).
- Signature expiry: unlinked wormhole signatures older than 3 days and other signatures
  untouched for 7 days are deleted (`maps::signatures::expire_signatures`).
- Pruning of connection-jump observations no connection claimed within 10 minutes

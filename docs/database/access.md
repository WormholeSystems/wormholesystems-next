# Access

Who can see and do what on a map: the `map_access` grants and the role / capability
model. Part of the [database spec](./README.md). Subjects reference EVE characters,
corporations, and alliances (see [Authentication](./authentication.md)) and grant a
role on a [map](./mapping.md#maps).

## `map_access`

Grants access to a map for a mix of characters, corporations, and alliances — each at
a role. The **owner** is just a `role = owner` row here; there is no `owner_id`.

| Column         | Type        | Notes                                         |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `id`           | pk          |                                               |
| `map_id`       | fk maps     |                                               |
| `subject_type` | enum        | `character`, `corporation`, `alliance`        |
| `subject_id`   | bigint      | EVE id of the character/corp/alliance         |
| `role`         | enum        | `viewer`, `member`, `manager`, `owner`        |
| `created_at`   | timestamptz |                                               |

**Invariants & expected behaviour**

- **A map has exactly one owner.** `owner` cannot be granted through `set_access`; it
  moves with `transfer_ownership`, which demotes the previous owner to `manager` and
  requires the new one to be a character already granted access. Creating a map makes its
  creator the owner.
- `expires_at` (nullable) ends a grant on its own. `null` is the ordinary grant, which
  lasts until it is revoked. A lapsed row is left in place but counts for nothing: it is
  excluded from every role lookup and from the map's own list of grants, so re-granting
  the same subject simply revives it.

- A map can hold **any mix** of subject types at once (e.g. one character + two
  corporations + one alliance), each with its own role.
- **Unique `(map_id, subject_id)`.** EVE entity ids are globally unique across
  characters, corporations, and alliances, so `subject_id` alone is unique per map;
  `subject_type` is descriptive. A given subject therefore holds exactly one role on
  a map.
- A map always has **at least one** `role = owner` row (this is the "every map has an
  owner" invariant; see [`maps`](./mapping.md#maps)).
- **Access check:** a user may access a map if, for any of their characters, that
  character's id, `corporation_id`, or `alliance_id` matches a `map_access` row's
  `subject_id`. The match is uniform — owner is no longer a special case.
- The user's **effective role** is the highest they match across all their characters
  (owner > manager > member > viewer).
- Because a grant can target a corporation or alliance, the check is only as correct as
  each character's stored affiliation. That freshness is maintained by
  [affiliation refresh](../processes.md#affiliation-refresh) (on login + periodic), so
  a character that leaves a granted corp/alliance loses that access within one refresh
  interval.

## Roles & capabilities

| Capability                                                        | Viewer | Member | Manager | Owner |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|
| View systems, connections, signatures                             |   ✅   |   ✅   |   ✅    |  ✅   |
| See **live** member locations (where pilots are)                  |   ❌   |   ✅   |   ✅    |  ✅   |
| Edit the graph: move systems, add/remove systems & connections, edit sig/connection state | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Manage access: add/remove people from the map                     |   ❌   |   ❌   |   ✅    |  ✅   |
| Modify the map itself: rename, settings, **delete**               |   ❌   |   ❌   |   ❌    |  ✅   |

The viewer-vs-member line is specifically: a **viewer sees the static map** (systems,
connections, signatures) but **not live pilot locations**; a **member** sees live
locations and can edit the graph. Live locations come from
[`character_status`](./tracking.md) and depend on the character having granted the
relevant ESI scopes (see [Authentication](./authentication.md)).

> **Open — owner constraints.** Two small follow-ups now that owner is a `map_access`
> role: (a) should an `owner` (and probably `manager`) grant be restricted to
> `subject_type = character`, since granting ownership to a whole corp/alliance is
> rarely intended? (b) Exactly one owner per map, or allow co-owners? "At least one"
> is already required; cap at one with a partial unique index if single-owner.

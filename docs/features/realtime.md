# Realtime map updates

Several people view and edit the same map at once. When one of them changes something —
places a system, marks a connection EOL, links a signature — the others should see it
without reloading. This doc specifies the **event system** behind that: how a change
becomes an event, how it reaches a viewer, and what the viewer does with it.

The application layer it sits above is [Map actions](./maps.md); the data it reflects is
the [mapping](../database/mapping.md) tables.

## Decision: an in-process bus, not Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY` or a broker

Mapping runs as a **single server process** and is expected to for the foreseeable future.
That makes the simplest option also the best one: an **in-process publish/subscribe bus**
([`MapHub`](../../src/maps/events.rs)) built on `tokio::broadcast`, one channel per `map_id`.

Why not the alternatives:

- **Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY`** would buy cross-instance delivery we don't need, at the cost
  of an 8 KB text payload limit and — the real dealbreaker — routing logic in SQL. The
  upcoming presence feature wants to notify "every user with access to map X that a tracked
  character moved"; access resolution is Rust logic over several tables, awkward to express
  in a trigger/`NOTIFY`. In-process, the producer just calls it.
- **A broker (Redis/NATS)** is infra we'd add only to scale past one process — premature.

If mapping ever needs to scale horizontally, the bus is the seam to swap: keep `MapEvent`,
back `MapHub` with `NOTIFY` or a broker. Nothing else changes.

## `MapEvent`

A typed enum, routed by `map_id`. It carries **what changed (ids), not the new data** —
consumers refetch the affected slice through the read actions. This "notify-then-refetch"
keeps payloads tiny and means there's exactly one source of truth (the DB read path), never
a half-applied push diff.

| Variant | Carries | Emitted when |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `MapUpdated` | `map_id` | name / description / image changed |
| `SystemAdded` / `SystemMoved` / `SystemRemoved` | `map_id`, `map_solar_system_id` | placement changes |
| `ConnectionChanged` | `map_id`, `connection_id` | connection added / removed / state changed (incl. trigger-driven sync) |
| `SignatureChanged` | `map_id`, `solar_system_id` | a signature added / edited / linked / unlinked / removed |
| `AccessChanged` | `map_id` | a grant or role changed |

Coarse on purpose: each variant names a slice the client re-reads. Finer payloads (e.g. the
changed row inline) are an additive change later if refetch volume warrants it.

## `MapHub`

A cheaply-cloneable handle (an `Arc<Mutex<HashMap<map_id, broadcast::Sender>>>` inside) held
in app state.

- `subscribe(map_id) -> Receiver` — one per connected viewer; lazily creates the map's channel.
- `publish(event)` — routes by `event.map_id()`; a no-op if nobody is watching that map, and
  prunes the channel once its last subscriber is gone so idle maps don't leak.

A receiver that falls behind the channel depth gets `Lagged`; the WebSocket layer treats that
as "you're behind" and triggers a full `get_map` rather than trying to replay.

## Where events come from — and the trigger interaction

The action functions in `src/maps/` stay **pure** (`fn(pool, actor, cmd)`, no realtime
dependency — they're driven straight from tests). Publishing happens at the **server-function
boundary** that calls them: after a mutation commits, the handler publishes the matching
`MapEvent`. Background producers (the future tracking poller) publish to the same hub directly.

This composes with the connection↔signature **sync trigger**
([sync spec](../database/mapping.md#keeping-a-connection-and-its-signatures-consistent)):
because every trigger firing is *downstream of an action the server already published for*,
and because events are notify-then-refetch, the client's refetch picks up the trigger-applied
changes too. The trigger never needs to emit anything itself.

## Status & what's deferred

Built now: `MapEvent` + `MapHub` (the bus, unit-tested in `events.rs`).

Deferred to the server/UI layer (none of it exists yet):

- the **Axum WebSocket endpoint** that subscribes a connection to its map and forwards events;
- the **Leptos client** subscription that maps an event to a `Resource` refetch, and does a
  full `get_map` on (re)connect so a missed event self-heals;
- the **`publish` calls** at the server-function boundary;
- **presence** (`Presence { map_id, character_id }`) from the tracking poller — the case that
  most justifies the in-process design.

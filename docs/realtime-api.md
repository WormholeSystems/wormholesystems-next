# The realtime API

The HTTP API answers questions; the WebSockets say when the answers have changed. A
client that holds a map open subscribes to the map's stream, and on every frame refetches
the slice the frame names. The frames carry ids, never data: there is one source of truth
(the read endpoints) and the socket only says which part of it to read again.

The design behind this is in [`features/realtime.md`](./features/realtime.md). This page
is the wire contract for a client.

## Endpoints

Both are plain WebSocket upgrades on the same origin as the API. They are not in the
OpenAPI document, since it cannot describe a stream.

| Endpoint | Who may connect | Frames |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| `GET /ws/map/{map_id}` | Anyone who may read the map: a grant at viewer or above, or the share it has been opened with (the `map_share_{map_id}` cookie the share route leaves behind). `404` otherwise, so a guesser learns nothing. | [`MapEvent`](#mapevent), one JSON object per text frame |
| `GET /ws/user` | A signed-in user. `401` otherwise. | [`UserEvent`](#userevent), one JSON object per text frame |

Authenticate the upgrade request the way you authenticate any other request: the session
cookie, or `Authorization: Bearer wst_...` with a personal access token.

The user socket doubles as the activity heartbeat. The server pings every 30 seconds; any
frame from the client (the pong will do) counts as activity and keeps the user's
`last_active_at` fresh, which is what lets the tracking poller follow their characters. A
script that only wants events can ignore this; a client that wants tracking to work must
keep the socket open and answer the pings, which every WebSocket library does by default.

## Frames

Every frame is a JSON object with a `type` field in `snake_case` and the ids the event is
about. The schemas are in the OpenAPI document under `components.schemas.MapEvent` and
`components.schemas.UserEvent`, kept there so a generated client has them too.

### `MapEvent`

| `type` | Fields | Sent when | Read again |
|--------|--------|-----------|------------|
| `map_updated` | `map_id` | The map's name, description or image changed | `GET /api/maps/{id}` |
| `system_added` | `map_id`, `map_solar_system_id` | A system was placed | `GET /api/maps/{id}` |
| `system_moved` | `map_id`, `map_solar_system_id` | A placement moved | `GET /api/maps/{id}` |
| `system_removed` | `map_id`, `map_solar_system_id` | A placement was removed | `GET /api/maps/{id}` |
| `system_details_changed` | `map_id`, `map_solar_system_id` | Alias, status, occupier, home, rally, pinned or notes changed; the position did not | `GET /api/maps/{id}`, and the placement's details if you show notes |
| `connection_changed` | `map_id`, `connection_id` | A connection was added, removed, or had its mass, lifetime or size change, including the changes the signature sync trigger makes | `GET /api/maps/{id}` |
| `signature_changed` | `map_id`, `solar_system_id` | A signature in that system was added, edited, linked, unlinked or removed | `GET /api/maps/{id}/signatures` |
| `access_changed` | `map_id` | A grant was made, changed or revoked | `GET /api/maps/{id}/access`, and your own role |
| `watchlist_changed` | `map_id` | A watchlist entry was added, pinned or removed | `GET /api/maps/{id}/watchlist` |
| `ignored_systems_changed` | `map_id` | The map's ignore list changed | `GET /api/maps/{id}/ignored` |
| `characters_changed` | `map_id` | A tracked pilot moved, changed ship, or came on or offline | `GET /api/maps/{id}/characters` |
| `killmail_received` | `map_id` | Something died in one of the map's systems | `GET /api/maps/{id}/killmails` |
| `history_changed` | `map_id` | The command journal grew, or an undo or redo moved the map to another point in it. After an undo anything may have changed | `GET /api/maps/{id}/events`, and the whole map |

One more frame is not an event: `{"type":"lagged"}` means the client fell behind the
channel and frames were dropped. Treat it as "everything may have changed" and refetch the
map.

### `UserEvent`

| `type` | Fields | Sent when | Read again |
|--------|--------|-----------|------------|
| `character_status_changed` | `character_id` | One of your characters was seen somewhere else, in another ship, or came on or offline | `GET /api/me/status` |
| `server_status_changed` | | Tranquility went up, went down, or changed version. Sent to everyone connected | `GET /api/server-status` |

## What a client should do

1. Fetch what it needs over HTTP.
2. Open the socket and, for each frame, refetch the slice in the last column above. Coalesce
   bursts: a paste of twenty signatures is twenty `signature_changed` frames for one system,
   and one refetch is enough.
3. On `lagged`, on reconnect, and on `history_changed`, refetch the map itself.

The frames say nothing a client could not learn by polling; they only say when.

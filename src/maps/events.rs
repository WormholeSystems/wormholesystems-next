//! In-process realtime event bus for map changes.
//!
//! Mapping runs as a **single server**, so we don't need a cross-instance bus (Postgres
//! `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, Redis, …). A typed [`MapEvent`] is published to an in-process
//! [`MapHub`] — one `tokio::broadcast` channel per `map_id` — and the (future) WebSocket
//! layer subscribes per connected viewer and forwards events so the client refetches the
//! affected slice. Background producers (e.g. the tracking poller) publish to the same hub
//! directly, which is exactly the routing that `LISTEN/NOTIFY` makes awkward.
//!
//! Events are **notify-then-refetch**: a payload names *what* changed (ids), not the new
//! data. The client re-reads via the read actions; on (re)connect it does a full `get_map`,
//! so a missed event self-heals. See [`docs/features/realtime.md`](../../docs/features/realtime.md).

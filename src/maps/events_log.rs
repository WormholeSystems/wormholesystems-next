//! The map's history tree: reading it, and moving the map through it.
//!
//! Rows are written by [`command::execute`](super::command::execute) inside the same
//! transaction as the change they describe, so the log can never drift from the state.
//! Steps form a tree (each points at the step that was current when it was applied) and
//! the map holds a cursor onto it, so undo and redo *move* rather than append. Undoing and
//! then making a new change branches instead of destroying the old step, and a branch stays
//! reachable through [`goto`].
//!
//! Each step stores both directions: `inverse` undoes it, `forward` re-applies it. They are
//! not written by hand. Applying one direction produces the other as its own inverse, which
//! is what keeps restored rows on their original ids however often you walk back and forth.

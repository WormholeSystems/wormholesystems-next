//! Is Tranquility up?
//!
//! Two jobs. The visible one is the header indicator: players online, and EVE's own clock.
//! The load-bearing one is the gate — during downtime every authenticated ESI call fails,
//! and hammering a server that is rebooting just burns through the error limit for nothing.
//! So the pollers that talk to ESI ask [`ServerWatch::should_poll`] before each tick, and
//! this loop is the only one that keeps running, because it is what notices the recovery.

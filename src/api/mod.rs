//! The JSON HTTP API: plain Axum handlers over the [`crate::maps`] actions, plus the
//! realtime WebSocket handlers. This is the client/server boundary for the SvelteKit
//! frontend.
//!
//! One module per area, each owning its handlers, its routes and the wire types it serves.
//! [`extract`] holds the shared request plumbing, [`router`] merges the area routers.
//!
//! The acting [`Actor`](crate::maps::Actor) is resolved server-side from the session
//! cookie or a bearer token ([`extract::Credentials`]), never sent by the client. Each
//! mutating handler publishes the matching [`MapEvent`](crate::maps::MapEvent) to the hub
//! after the action commits.

const DESCRIPTION: &str = "\
Everything the map screen does goes over this API, and all of it is open to a script \
holding a personal access token. It is generated from the same handlers and wire types \
the frontend uses, so it is complete and current by construction.

**Pre-alpha.** The API follows the frontend and changes with it, without notice and \
without a migration path. Pin the version you tested against and expect to revisit.

Sign in with the session cookie a browser holds, or send `Authorization: Bearer wst_...` \
with a token minted under Settings, API tokens. A token acts as the user who made it, with \
exactly their access. Endpoints marked with no security requirement are public; the ones \
that also accept a share token (`?share=`) say so in their parameters.

Live updates go over WebSockets, which this document cannot describe: see \
`docs/realtime-api.md` in the repository.";

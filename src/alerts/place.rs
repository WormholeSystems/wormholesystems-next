//! Fires when a system is placed on the map: the chain just changed shape, so anything it
//! was too far from a moment ago might not be now. An alert with a starting point also
//! fires when a wormhole is mapped, since that edge can complete the route from there to
//! the target without anything being placed.
//!
//! The claim is per placement, so a system added, removed and added again is a new occasion
//! worth a message, while a hundred other edits are not. With a starting point the claim is
//! per route instead: however many placements and connections report the same way to the
//! target, it is said once, and a new way is a new occasion.
